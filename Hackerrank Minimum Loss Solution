/*Lauren has a chart of distinct projected prices for a house over the next several years. She must buy the house in one year and sell it in another, and she must do so at a loss. She wants to minimize her financial loss.

For example, the house is valued at price=[20,15,8,2,12]  over the next n=5 years. She can purchase the home in any year, but she must resell the house at a loss in one of the following years. Her minimum loss would be incurred by purchasing in year 2 at price[1]=15 and reselling in year 5 at price[4]=12

Find and print the minimum amount of money Lauren must lose if she buys the house and resells it within the next n years.

Note: It's guaranteed that a valid answer exists.*/
